Hello there
======

My name is Carter Fausett. I've lived in northern Utah my entire life. I enjoy watching & playing football, playing pickleball, and doing yard work with my family. I also enjoy playing video games when I've got the time.
I went to high school at NUAMES and graduated with an Associate degree in general studies. From there I went to the University of Utah for a few semesters until scholarships ran out. Since then I've been at Weber State University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science. I'm expected to graduate the summer of 2025.
