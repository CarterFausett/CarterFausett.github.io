Hello there
======

My name is Carter Fausett. I've lived in northern Utah my entire life. I enjoy watching & playing football, playing pickleball, and doing yard work with my family. I also enjoy playing video games when I've got the time.
I went to high school at NUAMES and graduated with an Associate's degree in general studies. From there I went to the University of Utah for a few semesters until scholarships ran out. Since then I've been at Weber State University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science; on the way there I've earned my Certificate of Proficiency in programming basics and my Associate's degree in computer science. I'm expected to finally graduate in the summer of 2025.

While attending The U and Weber State I've worked for CSU full time in the summer and part time the rest of the year to pay for school. I've had the opportunity to work with a lot of amazing people that have been great examples of work ethic that, frankly, I don't think I'll ever live up to. Despite CSU being a general contractor with a focus on petroleum fuel work, I have learned a lot of skills that transfer over to the computer science field. The first being troubleshooting experience. I've been able to troubleshoot problems in systems that I haven't had any formal training on, and have been forced to be extremely resourceful in getting my hands on any kind of documentation for systems I've been tasked with fixing. The second would be a good work ethic. I've learned to stay and work until the work is done. This has resulted in many long and miserable days, but I have always done my best and been proud of the work I've done.
