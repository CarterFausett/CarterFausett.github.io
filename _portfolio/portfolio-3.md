This invoice management system was the final group project for my .NET Development class. This project was done with 2 other classmates. I created the initial "start" page that the user interfaces with upon opening the program. This page served as a bridge between the two other pages my groupmates created. We each had different functions that we could call from the other pages to get necessary information that our page used to display an initial context for the user. This was the first project I have done that required combining a database with an overlying application. This project built on previous assignments where we had first created a WPF application, then done some basic database work with a WPF application, to finally creating this invoice management system. I am proud of the work I've done on this one.
