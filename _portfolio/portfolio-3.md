This CStore UST Management application is still a work in progress. My plans for this are to simplify the data organization of the Maverik UST marking project I currently manage at work. This WPF application will have an underlying database to store all of the required data for mapping tank size and product information to different sites. With this database, the application will allow a user to select a list of sites and it will generate a spreadsheet of the tank marking tag part numbers that will allow the user to more quickly order parts for upcoming site construction / rebranding.
