For the capstone class of my Bachelor's degree, I worked in a team of 12 student developers on the website for the Sunridge HOA, a community of cabins and lots up by Powder Mountain. Sunridge had a list of 27 features and crucial bugfixes they asked us to implement over the course of a semester (Summer 2025). Most of my work for this project was focused around invoicing and account / site security. I worked in a group of 3 on overhauling the invoice system used by the HOA board to collect yearly dues, key costs, and fines. That required development through the entire stack, with the bulk of my work being in the JavaScript used in displaying invoice data, and in some cases, using AJAX calls and the like to send data to the server to be processed. 
Near the end of the project I discovered we had several pages that could be viewed by a client without logging in. I worked with another developer to find vulnerable pages and implement fixes that would prevent non-logged clients from accessing restricted pages (and owners from accessing admin pages). I thoroughly enjoyed my time on this project and I am very proud of my work in it.
