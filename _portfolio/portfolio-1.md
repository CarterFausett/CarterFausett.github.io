This LMS (Learning Management System) was created by me and 4 other fantastic people for our Software Engineering II class. I performed the initial setup of the site and database, added every chart and graph, assisted one of my group mates with the payment system, implemented the calendar, wrote unit tests for some of the underlying assignment submission creation methods, and recorded UI tests for account creation and log in. There were some times that I butted heads with group mates through the semester, but ultimately I believe we did good work and worked out any problems and miscommunications we had.
